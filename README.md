# downloadthread
Download thread is an extension for MyBB.  It is used in order to download a thread into a specific format.

## Changes between this fork and main: 
1. Group permissions are controlled via plugin settings instead of group pages
2. Download thread button can be toggled between showing up at top and bottom of page (next to addpost)
or just at bottom of page (next to search thread)
3. Replaced the download icon with inline Download thread button
4. Pressing Download thread button asks user for confirmation before continuing

Thanks to Dragonexpert & Laird for creating the plugin.
