# downloadthread
Download thread is an extension for MyBB.  It is used in order to download a thread into a specific format.

## Changes between this fork and main: 
* Group permissions are controlled via plugin settings instead of group pages
* Download thread button can be toggled between showing up at top and bottom of page (next to addpost)
or just at bottom of page (next to search thread)
* Replaced the download icon with inline Download thread button
* Pressing Download thread button asks user for confirmation before continuing

Thanks to Dragonexpert & Laird for creating the plugin.
